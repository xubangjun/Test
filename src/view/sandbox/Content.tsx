        Son Heung-min (Korean: 손흥민; Korean pronunciation: [son.ɣɯŋ.min]; born 8 July 1992) is a South Korean professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and the South Korea national team.[3] He is recognised for his speed, finishing, two-footedness, and ability to link play.[6][7]

Born in Chuncheon, South Korea, Son relocated to Germany to join Hamburger SV at 16, making his debut in the Bundesliga in 2010. In 2013, he moved to Bayer Leverkusen for a club record €10 million before signing for Tottenham for £22 million two years later, becoming the most expensive Asian player in history.[8] While at Tottenham, Son became the top Asian goalscorer in both Premier League and Champions League history,[9] and surpassed Cha Bum-kun's record for most goals scored by a Korean player in European competition.[10][11][12] In 2019, he became the second Asian in history to reach and start a UEFA Champions League final after compatriot Park Ji-sung.[13] In the 2021–22 season, alongside Mohamed Salah, he won the Premier League Golden Boot award with 23 goals, becoming the first Asian player to win it.[14] In April 2023, he became the first Asian player to score 100 Premier League goals. He is also the club's fifth-highest goalscorer and all-time leader in assists. Son is the third Tottenham player to make 300 Premier League appearances for the club, after Hugo Lloris and Harry Kane.[15]
